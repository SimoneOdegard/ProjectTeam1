## Conflict plan

**What is the group process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**
- Everyone on team voices their opinions.
    - This is a safe place to say what you need to say.
- When making a decision, we can vote and majority rules.

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**
- Keep open communication
    - Ask for help
    - Ask if the person needs help
    - Positive encouragment
    - No bad questions
    - It's important to be wrong
- Take time to help others

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**
- Attempted talking one on one. Attempted talking as a group. If that doesn't work out, bring in JB. We may need an outside voice with higher authority.

## Communication Plan

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**
- Slack for project communication
- Discord for memes
- Meeting times:
    - 9am meeting with JB
    - 9:15am-12:00pm meeting with team and work on project
    - 12:00pm-1:00pm Lunch
    - 1:00pm-6:00pm(+) meet with team and work on project
- Outside hours communication:
    - Ok to contact but don't assume you'll get a response from 9pm-9am on weekdays

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

- Start every morning meeting with a built in roundabout conversation where everyone can speak what's on their mind

**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**
- Constructive criticism
- No passive aggressive behavior, be direct
- Positive toward each other
